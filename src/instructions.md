1. Display a list of movies where each movie contains a list of users that favorited it. Let's do something a little bit more complicated. Instead of displaying a list of users and their movies, this time you need to display a list of movies.

2. For each movie in the list, there are two options:

3. If the movie has been favorited, then display a list of all of the users who said that this movie was their favorite.
4. If the movie has *not* been favorited, display some text stating that no one favorited the movie.
